# Growing like China
Replication of Zheng Song, Kjetil Storesletten & Fabrizio Zilibotti (2011), "Growing Like China," *American Economic Review*,  vol. 101(1), pages 196-233 in Python.

## Roadmap
So far, only a non-Pythonic version called `literal_replication.py` exists. It follows the authors' [Matlab code](http://doi.org/10.3886/E112395V1 "link to authors' original code") very closely by translating Matlab code almost literally into Python using the numpy and pandas libraries.

I am working on the new `replication.py`, which uses more of Python's capabilities.
