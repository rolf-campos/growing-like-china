# Growing like China
Replication of Zheng Song, Kjetil Storesletten & Fabrizio Zilibotti (2011), "Growing Like China," *American Economic Review*,  vol. 101(1), pages 196-233 in Python.

## Details
There are two codes that replicate the paper:

+ `literal_replication.py` follows the authors' [own code](http://doi.org/10.3886/E112395V1 "link to authors' original code") very closely by translating Matlab code almost literally into Python using the numpy and pandas libraries.
+ `replication.py` sets up classes for entrepreneurs and workers, yielding a more Pythonic approach.
